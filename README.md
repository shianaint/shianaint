MY previous work experience

My previous work experiences are a live chat agent and email suppport. In our account, we have three types of support: chat support, email support, and phone call support. First of all, I'd like to share an overview of the website from my previous job. Our website offers a searchable database of aggregated public records, allowing users to search for personal information such as full names, phone numbers, social media accounts, addresses, criminal records, and even vehicle details. My role involved guiding customers on how to navigate and utilize these features, assisting with account-related queries, educating new users about the platform, helping with account cancellations, and issuing refunds when customers forgot to cancel their subscriptions, as all plans included recurring charges. We replicate a search for customer's confusion as well to double-check and ensure that they utilize the platforms properly. We also create ticket and submit the requests that are beyond my level of expertise to our escalation teams.

Moreover, we also address concerns related to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) to ensure that our website complies with legal requirements and that users understand the limitations of its use. The FCRA governs how personal data can be used for specific purposes, such as employment background checks, tenant screening, and credit assessments. To comply with these regulations, we make it clear that our website should not be used for these FCRA-governed purposes. Our platform is designed for general information searches and public records aggregation, but it is not intended for making decisions that fall under FCRA guidelines and we are helping to protect both the users and individuals whose data is accessed.
